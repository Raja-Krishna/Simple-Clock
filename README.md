## Description
It is  a digital clock chrome extension. I wanted to keep the design as minimal as possible and also reduce the size of the extension. So instead of regular BORING backgrounds, i tried to use CSS gradients to see if i could come up with something.

## Inspiration
Tried every possible way and the gradients were bad. So as a last resort i googled to see if i could have a multi-colored CSS gradient without actually having a transition from color to color. Then i stumbled upon this post:

## Logo
Exclusively made for this extension. Used Illustrator to make the logo.
