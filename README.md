## Description
It is  a digital clock chrome extension. I wanted to keep the design as minimal as possible and also reduce the size of the extension. So instead of regular BORING backgrounds, i tried to use CSS gradients to see if i could come up with something.

## Logo
Exclusively made for this extension. Used Illustrator to make the logo.
